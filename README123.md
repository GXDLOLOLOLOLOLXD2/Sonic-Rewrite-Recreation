### Instructions for Installing Libraries

1. **Install Haxe**: If you haven't already installed Haxe, download and install it from the [Haxe website](https://haxe.org/download/).

2. **Install Haxelib**: Haxelib is the package manager for Haxe. It comes bundled with Haxe, but you can verify its installation by running:
   ```bash
   haxelib version
   ```

3. **Create the `hmm.json` File**: In the root directory of your project, create a file named `hmm.json` and copy the JSON content provided above into it.

4. **Install Dependencies**: Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the root directory of your project, and run the following command to install the libraries specified in `hmm.json`:
   ```bash
   haxelib install
   ```

5. **Verify Installation**: After the installation completes, you can verify that the libraries are installed by running:
   ```bash
   haxelib list
   ```

6. **Build Your Project**: Finally, you can build your project using the Haxe compiler. Make sure you have a `build.hxml` file set up correctly for your project, and run:
   ```bash
   haxe build.hxml
   ```

### Additional Notes

- Ensure that the versions specified in the `hmm.json` file are compatible with your project. You may need to adjust them based on your specific requirements or the latest available versions.
- If you encounter any issues during installation, refer to the documentation for each library for troubleshooting tips.
